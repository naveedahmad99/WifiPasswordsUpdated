## Troubleshooting
In case the app is unable to find the file containing your saved wifi passwords please google your device's path for the saved wifi passwords file.

then insert it manually into the app's settings.

the most commonly used paths by manufacturers which the app automatically tries are: 
- /data/misc/wifi/wpa_supplicant.conf
- /data/wifi/bcm_supp.conf
- /data/misc/wifi/wpa.conf
